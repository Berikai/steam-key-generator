# Steam Key Generator
A steam key generator console app written in C#.

### Is it really generating valid steam keys?
The answer is actually, no. There are 36^15 possibilities of steam key format which is a really HUGE! The program generates keys in that format but the possibility for the program to generate a valid key is really difficult. Also, be aware that there is a limit to how many keys you can redeem at a time. It's around 25 a day. All the things said, it really seems not possible to get a working key but you are free to try!

### If this thing won't generate a valid key, why you coded this? What is the purpose of it?
Well, I don't know. I might say I just want to test my skills but it's not a big deal to code something like this. I was just bored and coded this thing.

### You can code the same program with less and clean code. It's dirty-coded!
Oh, sorry about that. It would be great if you create a pull request and show me a better way to code even a small and simple program like this. It's not a joke, I just want to learn if there is something I can learn :)

### Why are you posting this on github, isn't it actually meaningless? Why are you even create a readme for this?
Lol, there are some reasons about that. There are not many repo's in my profile recently (25 Feb 2022). So, I thought maybe it's a good start to filling my profile. I also just want to write some readme file to a project.

### Okey, I'm out. Peace ✌️
Goodbye, then. C ya!
